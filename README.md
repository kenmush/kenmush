### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kennedy Mutisya, a developer and content producer, passionate about open source and creating technical content for a variety of audiences.

I love PHP, and I've been working mostly on command-line tools lately. Here's some projects I'm excited about right now:

- [Untapped Waters](https://untappedwaters.com) - Connecting to IOT to digital payments.
- [ElitePro Security](https://eliteprosecurity.tech) - A digital workforce manager for the security industry
