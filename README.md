### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kennedy Mutisya, a developer and content producer, passionate about open source and creating technical content for a variety of audiences.

I love PHP, and I've been working mostly on command-line tools lately. Here's some projects I'm excited about right now:

- [Minicli](https://github.com/minicli/minicli) - A minimalist framework for command-line centric PHP apps.
- [Streamaru](https://github.com/erikaheidi/streamaru) - An experimental collection of tools for live streaming with OBS.
